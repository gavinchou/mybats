Tuning:EADGBe

This is the tab for the first version, not the one that was released 2008

To do the"clicking"sound: gently lift your fingers from the fretboard of the guitar but
keep your finger in the position of the chord. Use use right palm to mute the strings. 
should sound kind of reggea (use a plectrum to
get more "clicking")

this is an example of how to play the chords.

y= gently lift your fingers and strum downwards (clicking sound)
x= gently lift your fungers and strum upwards (clicking sound)

Of course, you don't have to play this clicking sound just play the chords if you find 
hard to play it this way.

     B
Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
  F#
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
  G#m
I fell right through the cracks
            E
and now I'm trying to get back
           B
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
F#
Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
  G#m                           E
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

B             F#             G#m
I won't hesitate no more, no more
          E
It cannot wait, I'm yours

B-F#-G#m-E

Verse2 *same chords*
Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love
Listen to the music of the moment maybe sing with me
A l¨¢ peaceful melodies

*until:*
G#m                                      E                    Fdim
     It's your God-forsaken right to be loved love loved love loved

*same chords*
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

*Now he starts humming *
Same click-sound

Lyrics:

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I'm saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me.
Open up your plans and damn your free.
I look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours.
So please dont please dont please dont theres no need to complicate.
Cause our time is short.
This is this is this is our fait.

Im yours...
