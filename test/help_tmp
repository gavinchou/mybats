Runs a specified command for each file in a set of files. 
FOR %variable IN (set) DO command [command-parameters] 
  %variable  Specifies a single letter replaceable parameter. 
  (set)      Specifies a set of one or more files.  Wildcards may be used. 
  command    Specifies the command to carry out for each file. 
  command-parameters 
             Specifies parameters or switches for the specified command. 
To use the FOR command in a batch program, specify %%variable instead 
of %variable.  Variable names are case sensitive, so %i is different 
from %I. 
If Command Extensions are enabled, the following additional 
forms of the FOR command are supported: 
FOR /D %variable IN (set) DO command [command-parameters] 
    If set contains wildcards, then specifies to match against directory 
    names instead of file names. 
FOR /R [[drive:]path] %variable IN (set) DO command [command-parameters] 
    Walks the directory tree rooted at [drive:]path, executing the FOR 
    statement in each directory of the tree.  If no directory 
    specification is specified after /R then the current directory is 
    assumed.  If set is just a single period (.) character then it 
    will just enumerate the directory tree. 
FOR /L %variable IN (start,step,end) DO command [command-parameters] 
    The set is a sequence of numbers from start to end, by step amount. 
    So (1,1,5) would generate the sequence 1 2 3 4 5 and (5,-1,1) would 
    generate the sequence (5 4 3 2 1) 
FOR /F ["options"] %variable IN (file-set) DO command [command-parameters] 
FOR /F ["options"] %variable IN ("string") DO command [command-parameters] 
FOR /F ["options"] %variable IN ('command') DO command [command-parameters] 
    or, if usebackq option present: 
FOR /F ["options"] %variable IN (file-set) DO command [command-parameters] 
FOR /F ["options"] %variable IN ('string') DO command [command-parameters] 
FOR /F ["options"] %variable IN (`command`) DO command [command-parameters] 
    file-set is one or more file names.  Each file is opened, read 
    and processed before going on to the next file in file-set. 
    Processing consists of reading in the file, breaking it up into 
    individual lines of text and then parsing each line into zero or 
    more tokens.  The body of the for loop is then called with the 
    variable value(s) set to the found token string(s).  By default, /F 
    passes the first blank separated token from each line of each file. 
    Blank lines are skipped.  You can override the default parsing 
    behavior by specifying the optional "options" parameter.  This 
    is a quoted string which contains one or more keywords to specify 
    different parsing options.  The keywords are: 
        eol=c           - specifies an end of line comment character 
                          (just one) 
        skip=n          - specifies the number of lines to skip at the 
                          beginning of the file. 
        delims=xxx      - specifies a delimiter set.  This replaces the 
                          default delimiter set of space and tab. 
        tokens=x,y,m-n  - specifies which tokens from each line are to 
                          be passed to the for body for each iteration. 
                          This will cause additional variable names to 
                          be allocated.  The m-n form is a range, 
                          specifying the mth through the nth tokens.  If 
                          the last character in the tokens= string is an 
                          asterisk, then an additional variable is 
                          allocated and receives the remaining text on 
                          the line after the last token parsed. 
        usebackq        - specifies that the new semantics are in force, 
                          where a back quoted string is executed as a 
                          command and a single quoted string is a 
                          literal string command and allows the use of 
                          double quotes to quote file names in 
                          file-set. 
    Some examples might help: 
FOR /F "eol=; tokens=2,3* delims=, " %i in (myfile.txt) do @echo %i %j %k 
    would parse each line in myfile.txt, ignoring lines that begin with 
    a semicolon, passing the 2nd and 3rd token from each line to the for 
    body, with tokens delimited by commas and/or spaces.  Notice the for 
    body statements reference %i to get the 2nd token, %j to get the 
    3rd token, and %k to get all remaining tokens after the 3rd.  For 
    file names that contain spaces, you need to quote the filenames with 
    double quotes.  In order to use double quotes in this manner, you also 
    need to use the usebackq option, otherwise the double quotes will be 
    interpreted as defining a literal string to parse. 
    %i is explicitly declared in the for statement and the %j and %k 
    are implicitly declared via the tokens= option.  You can specify up 
    to 26 tokens via the tokens= line, provided it does not cause an 
    attempt to declare a variable higher than the letter 'z' or 'Z'. 
    Remember, FOR variables are single-letter, case sensitive, global, 
    and you can't have more than 52 total active at any one time. 
    You can also use the FOR /F parsing logic on an immediate string, by 
    making the file-set between the parenthesis a quoted string, 
    using single quote characters.  It will be treated as a single line 
    of input from a file and parsed. 
    Finally, you can use the FOR /F command to parse the output of a 
    command.  You do this by making the file-set between the 
    parenthesis a back quoted string.  It will be treated as a command 
    line, which is passed to a child CMD.EXE and the output is captured 
    into memory and parsed as if it was a file.  So the following 
    example: 
      FOR /F "usebackq delims==" %i IN (`set`) DO @echo %i 
    would enumerate the environment variable names in the current 
    environment. 
In addition, substitution of FOR variable references has been enhanced. 
You can now use the following optional syntax: 
    %~I         - expands %I removing any surrounding quotes (") 
    %~fI        - expands %I to a fully qualified path name 
    %~dI        - expands %I to a drive letter only 
    %~pI        - expands %I to a path only 
    %~nI        - expands %I to a file name only 
    %~xI        - expands %I to a file extension only 
    %~sI        - expanded path contains short names only 
    %~aI        - expands %I to file attributes of file 
    %~tI        - expands %I to date/time of file 
    %~zI        - expands %I to size of file 
    %~$PATH:I   - searches the directories listed in the PATH 
                   environment variable and expands %I to the 
                   fully qualified name of the first one found. 
                   If the environment variable name is not 
                   defined or the file is not found by the 
                   search, then this modifier expands to the 
                   empty string 
The modifiers can be combined to get compound results: 
    %~dpI       - expands %I to a drive letter and path only 
    %~nxI       - expands %I to a file name and extension only 
    %~fsI       - expands %I to a full path name with short names only 
    %~dp$PATH:I - searches the directories listed in the PATH 
                   environment variable for %I and expands to the 
                   drive letter and path of the first one found. 
    %~ftzaI     - expands %I to a DIR like output line 
In the above examples %I and PATH can be replaced by other valid 
values.  The %~ syntax is terminated by a valid FOR variable name. 
Picking upper case variable names like %I makes it more readable and 
avoids confusion with the modifiers, which are not case sensitive.

BCDEDIT - Boot Configuration Data Store Editor 
The Bcdedit.exe command-line tool modifies the boot configuration data store. 
The boot configuration data store contains boot configuration parameters and 
controls how the operating system is booted. These parameters were previously 
in the Boot.ini file (in BIOS-based operating systems) or in the nonvolatile 
RAM entries (in Extensible Firmware Interface-based operating systems). You can 
use Bcdedit.exe to add, delete, edit, and append entries in the boot 
configuration data store. 
example, to display detailed information about the /createstore command, type: 
Commands that operate on a store 
================================ 
/createstore    Creates a new and empty boot configuration data store. 
/export         Exports the contents of the system store to a file. This file 
                can be used later to restore the state of the system store. 
/import         Restores the state of the system store using a backup file 
                created with the /export command. 
/sysstore       Sets the system store device (only affects EFI systems, does 
                not persist across reboots, and is only used in cases where 
                the system store device is ambiguous). 
Commands that operate on entries in a store 
=========================================== 
/copy           Makes copies of entries in the store. 
/create         Creates new entries in the store. 
/delete         Deletes entries from the store. 
/mirror         Creates mirror of entries in the store. 
Commands that operate on entry options 
====================================== 
/deletevalue    Deletes entry options from the store. 
/set            Sets entry option values in the store. 
Commands that control output 
============================ 
/enum           Lists entries in the store. 
/v              Command-line option that displays entry identifiers in full, 
                rather than using names for well-known identifiers. 
                Use /v by itself as a command to display entry identifiers 
                in full for the ACTIVE type. 
Running "bcdedit" by itself is equivalent to running "bcdedit /enum ACTIVE". 
Commands that control the boot manager 
====================================== 
/bootsequence   Sets the one-time boot sequence for the boot manager. 
/default        Sets the default entry that the boot manager will use. 
/displayorder   Sets the order in which the boot manager displays the 
                multiboot menu. 
/timeout        Sets the boot manager time-out value. 
/toolsdisplayorder  Sets the order in which the boot manager displays 
                    the tools menu. 
Commands that control Emergency Management Services for a boot application 
========================================================================== 
/bootems        Enables or disables Emergency Management Services 
                for a boot application. 
/ems            Enables or disables Emergency Management Services for an 
                operating system entry. 
/emssettings    Sets the global Emergency Management Services parameters. 
Command that control debugging 
============================== 
/bootdebug      Enables or disables boot debugging for a boot application. 
/dbgsettings    Sets the global debugger parameters. 
/debug          Enables or disables kernel debugging for an operating system 
                entry. 
/hypervisorsettings  Sets the hypervisor parameters.

Calls one batch program from another. 
CALL [drive:][path]filename [batch-parameters] 
  batch-parameters   Specifies any command-line information required by the 
                     batch program. 
If Command Extensions are enabled CALL changes as follows: 
CALL command now accepts labels as the target of the CALL.  The syntax 
is: 
    CALL :label arguments 
A new batch file context is created with the specified arguments and 
control is passed to the statement after the label specified.  You must 
"exit" twice by reaching the end of the batch script file twice.  The 
first time you read the end, control will return to just after the CALL 
for a description of the GOTO :EOF extension that will allow you to 
"return" from a batch script. 
In addition, expansion of batch script argument references (%0, %1, 
etc.) have been changed as follows: 
    %* in a batch script refers to all the arguments (e.g. %1 %2 %3 
        %4 %5 ...) 
    Substitution of batch parameters (%n) has been enhanced.  You can 
    now use the following optional syntax: 
        %~1         - expands %1 removing any surrounding quotes (") 
        %~f1        - expands %1 to a fully qualified path name 
        %~d1        - expands %1 to a drive letter only 
        %~p1        - expands %1 to a path only 
        %~n1        - expands %1 to a file name only 
        %~x1        - expands %1 to a file extension only 
        %~s1        - expanded path contains short names only 
        %~a1        - expands %1 to file attributes 
        %~t1        - expands %1 to date/time of file 
        %~z1        - expands %1 to size of file 
        %~$PATH:1   - searches the directories listed in the PATH 
                       environment variable and expands %1 to the fully 
                       qualified name of the first one found.  If the 
                       environment variable name is not defined or the 
                       file is not found by the search, then this 
                       modifier expands to the empty string 
    The modifiers can be combined to get compound results: 
        %~dp1       - expands %1 to a drive letter and path only 
        %~nx1       - expands %1 to a file name and extension only 
        %~dp$PATH:1 - searches the directories listed in the PATH 
                       environment variable for %1 and expands to the 
                       drive letter and path of the first one found. 
        %~ftza1     - expands %1 to a DIR like output line 
    In the above examples %1 and PATH can be replaced by other 
    valid values.  The %~ syntax is terminated by a valid argument 
    number.  The %~ modifiers may not be used with %*

CHDIR [/D] [drive:][path] 
CHDIR [..] 
CD [/D] [drive:][path] 
CD [..] 
  ..   Specifies that you want to change to the parent directory. 
Type CD drive: to display the current directory in the specified drive. 
Type CD without parameters to display the current drive and directory. 
Use the /D switch to change current drive in addition to changing current

directory to C:\Temp if that is the case on disk. 
CHDIR command does not treat spaces as delimiters, so it is possible to 
CD into a subdirectory name that contains a space without surrounding 
the name with quotes.  For example: 
    cd \winnt\profiles\username\programs\start menu

The /I or /C switch reduces the amount of time required to run Chkdsk by 
skipping certain checks of the volume.

CHKNTFS /C volume [...] 
  volume         Specifies the drive letter (followed by a colon), 
                 mount point, or volume name. 
  /D             Restores the machine to the default behavior; all drives are 
                 checked at boot time and chkdsk is run on those that are 
                 dirty. 
  /T:time        Changes the AUTOCHK initiation countdown time to the 
                 specified amount of time in seconds.  If time is not 
                 specified, displays the current setting. 
  /X             Excludes a drive from the default boot-time check.  Excluded 
                 drives are not accumulated between command invocations. 
  /C             Schedules a drive to be checked at boot time; chkdsk will run 
                 if the drive is dirty. 
If no switches are specified, CHKNTFS will display if the specified drive is 
dirty or scheduled to be checked on next reboot.

/E:OFF  Disable command extensions (see below) 
/F:ON   Enable file and directory name completion characters (see below) 
/F:OFF  Disable file and directory name completion characters (see below) 
/V:ON   Enable delayed environment variable expansion using  as the 
        delimiter. For example, /V:ON would allow  to expand the 
        variable var at execution time.  The var syntax expands variables 
        at input time, which is quite a different thing when inside of a FOR 
        loop. 
/V:OFF  Disable delayed environment expansion. 
Note that multiple commands separated by the command separator '
are accepted for string if surrounded by quotes.  Also, for compatibility 
reasons, /X is the same as /E:ON, /Y is the same as /E:OFF and /R is the 
same as /C.  Any other switches are ignored. 
If /C or /K is specified, then the remainder of the command line after 
the switch is processed as a command line, where the following logic is 
used to process quote (") characters: 
    1.  If all of the following conditions are met, then quote characters 
        on the command line are preserved: 
        - no /S switch 
        - exactly two quote characters 
        - no special characters between the two quote characters, 
        - there are one or more whitespace characters between the 
          two quote characters 
        - the string between the two quote characters is the name 
          of an executable file. 
    2.  Otherwise, old behavior is to see if the first character is 
        a quote character and if so, strip the leading character and 
        remove the last quote character on the command line, preserving 
        any text after the last quote character. 
If /D was NOT specified on the command line, then when CMD.EXE starts, it 
looks for the following REG_SZ/REG_EXPAND_SZ registry variables, and if 
either or both are present, they are executed first. 
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun 
        and/or 
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun 
Command Extensions are enabled by default.  You may also disable 
extensions for a particular invocation by using the /E:OFF switch.  You 
can enable or disable extensions for all invocations of CMD.EXE on a 
machine and/or user logon session by setting either or both of the 
following REG_DWORD values in the registry using REGEDIT.EXE: 
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\EnableExtensions 
        and/or 
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\EnableExtensions 
to either 0x1 or 0x0.  The user specific setting takes precedence over 
the machine setting.  The command line switches take precedence over the 
registry settings. 
In a batch file, the SETLOCAL ENABLEEXTENSIONS or DISABLEEXTENSIONS arguments 
The command extensions involve changes and/or additions to the following 
commands: 
    DEL or ERASE 
    COLOR 
    CD or CHDIR 
    MD or MKDIR 
    PROMPT 
    PUSHD 
    POPD

Delayed environment variable expansion is NOT enabled by default.  You 
can enable or disable delayed environment variable expansion for a 
particular invocation of CMD.EXE with the /V:ON or /V:OFF switch.  You 
can enable or disable delayed expansion for all invocations of CMD.EXE on a 
machine and/or user logon session by setting either or both of the 
following REG_DWORD values in the registry using REGEDIT.EXE: 
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\DelayedExpansion 
        and/or 
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\DelayedExpansion 
to either 0x1 or 0x0.  The user specific setting takes precedence over 
the machine setting.  The command line switches take precedence over the 
registry settings. 
In a batch file the SETLOCAL ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION or DISABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION 
for details. 
If delayed environment variable expansion is enabled, then the exclamation 
character can be used to substitute the value of an environment variable 
at execution time. 
You can enable or disable file name completion for a particular 
invocation of CMD.EXE with the /F:ON or /F:OFF switch.  You can enable 
or disable completion for all invocations of CMD.EXE on a machine and/or 
user logon session by setting either or both of the following REG_DWORD 
values in the registry using REGEDIT.EXE: 
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\CompletionChar 
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\PathCompletionChar 
        and/or 
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\CompletionChar 
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\PathCompletionChar 
with the hex value of a control character to use for a particular 
function (e.g.  0x4 is Ctrl-D and 0x6 is Ctrl-F).  The user specific 
settings take precedence over the machine settings.  The command line 
switches take precedence over the registry settings. 
If completion is enabled with the /F:ON switch, the two control 
characters used are Ctrl-D for directory name completion and Ctrl-F for 
file name completion.  To disable a particular completion character in 
the registry, use the value for space (0x20) as it is not a valid 
control character. 
Completion is invoked when you type either of the two control 
characters.  The completion function takes the path string to the left 
of the cursor appends a wild card character to it if none is already 
present and builds up a list of paths that match.  It then displays the 
first matching path.  If no paths match, it just beeps and leaves the 
display alone.  Thereafter, repeated pressing of the same control 
character will cycle through the list of matching paths.  Pressing the 
Shift key with the control character will move through the list 
backwards.  If you edit the line in any way and press the control 
character again, the saved list of matching paths is discarded and a new 
one generated.  The same occurs if you switch between file and directory 
name completion.  The only difference between the two control characters 
is the file completion character matches both file and directory names, 
while the directory completion character only matches directory names. 
If file completion is used on any of the built in directory commands 
(CD, MD or RD) then directory completion is assumed. 
The completion code deals correctly with file names that contain spaces 
or other special characters by placing quotes around the matching path. 
Also, if you back up, then invoke completion from within a line, the 
text to the right of the cursor at the point completion was invoked is 
discarded. 
The special characters that require quotes are: 
=====================================================================================

===================================================================================== 
===================================================================================== 
Sets the default console foreground and background colors. 
COLOR [attr] 
  attr        Specifies color attribute of console output 
Color attributes are specified by TWO hex digits -- the first 
corresponds to the background; the second the foreground.  Each digit 
can be any of the following values: 
    0 = Black       8 = Gray 
    1 = Blue        9 = Light Blue 
    2 = Green       A = Light Green 
    3 = Aqua        B = Light Aqua 
    4 = Red         C = Light Red 
    5 = Purple      D = Light Purple 
    6 = Yellow      E = Light Yellow 
    7 = White       F = Bright White 
If no argument is given, this command restores the color to what it was 
when CMD.EXE started.  This value either comes from the current console 
window, the /T command line switch or from the DefaultColor registry 
value. 
The COLOR command sets ERRORLEVEL to 1 if an attempt is made to execute 
the COLOR command with a foreground and background color that are the 
same. 
Example: "COLOR fc" produces light red on bright white

Compares the contents of two files or sets of files. 
COMP [data1] [data2] [/D] [/A] [/L] [/N=number] [/C] [/OFF[LINE]] 
  data1      Specifies location and name(s) of first file(s) to compare. 
  data2      Specifies location and name(s) of second files to compare. 
  /D         Displays differences in decimal format. 
  /A         Displays differences in ASCII characters. 
  /L         Displays line numbers for differences. 
  /N=number  Compares only the first specified number of lines in each file. 
  /C         Disregards case of ASCII letters when comparing files. 
  /OFF[LINE] Do not skip files with offline attribute set. 
To compare sets of files, use wildcards in data1 and data2 parameters.

Displays or alters the compression of files on NTFS partitions. 
  /C        Compresses the specified files.  Directories will be marked 
            so that files added afterward will be compressed. 
  /U        Uncompresses the specified files.  Directories will be marked 
            so that files added afterward will not be compressed. 
  /S        Performs the specified operation on files in the given 
            directory and all subdirectories.  Default "dir" is the 
            current directory. 
  /A        Displays files with the hidden or system attributes.  These 
            files are omitted by default. 
  /I        Continues performing the specified operation even after errors 
            have occurred.  By default, COMPACT stops when an error is 
            encountered. 
  /F        Forces the compress operation on all specified files, even 
            those which are already compressed.  Already-compressed files 
            are skipped by default. 
  /Q        Reports only the most essential information. 
  filename  Specifies a pattern, file, or directory. 
  Used without parameters, COMPACT displays the compression state of 
  the current directory and any files it contains. You may use multiple 
  filenames and wildcards.  You must put spaces between multiple 
  parameters.
